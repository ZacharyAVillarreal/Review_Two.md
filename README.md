## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.
  In the game you are piloting one of two ships and moving through multiple levels with waves of aliens attacking earth. 
  
  The ships start out with a starting gun set to the players fire one button.This gun is the primary, do it all gun, the is great for clearing waves of enemies and hitting bosses. At the end of each level is an enemy fighter ship and a level boss, one both are defeated the game gives the player a choice of two power ups each meant to do the role with different styles. 
  
  
  Example is after the first boss, is given a choice of power ups that are used to deal with threats from behind and on the sides of the players ship, so anywhere that the main gun cannot reach. The first power up is a flame blast from the rear thrusters that shoots out in a short range at in a fan, dealing more damage the closer the target is to the origin of the flame. The other power up is an electric attack that shoots out on the left and right side of the ship and at a 45% angle infront of the ship. Both power ups are great for dealing with enemies not directly in front of the ship.
  

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
